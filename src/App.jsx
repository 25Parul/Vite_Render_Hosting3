    Orcas: Majestic Marine Predators and Ecosystem Guardians
    </h1>
    <p Style= "font-size: 30px">
    Orcas, also known as killer whales, are highly intelligent and social creatures that play a critical role in marine ecosystems. As apex predators, they maintain the balance of the oceanic food web by controlling the populations of their prey, including fish, squid, and marine mammals. Orcas exhibit complex social structures and sophisticated communication systems, making them one of the most fascinating species in the animal kingdom. However, the survival of orcas is threatened by factors such as pollution, habitat loss, overfishing, and climate change. Conservation efforts, including protection of their habitats, reducing pollution, and responsible whale-watching practices, are essential to ensure the continued existence of these magnificent marine beings and the preservation of the delicate ecosystems they inhabit.
